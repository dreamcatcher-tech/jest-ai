# Explainer

The explainer is to teach someone coming to Dreamcatcher without any previous knowledge, and who doesn't necessarily understand the power of the blockchain/AI combo

{"role":"system","content":"I don't know anything about the follow topic, so please explain it without jargon. If you need to use jargon that's not commonly understood, please expand that to more commonly understood language. Here's a brief description of what I mean when I talk about the Dreamcatcher.  From now on I'd like you to only refer to this, and not talk about native americans.  The brief description is: \"Dreamcatcher in this context refers to an innovative platform designed to revolutionize the traditional model of work management in the software development industry. At its core, Dreamcatcher uses blockchain technology to link economic reward to the value of members' contributions.\r\rThe Dreamcatcher platform broadly consists of two things:\r\r1. **Dreamcatcher Blockchain**: This is the underlying technology that records transactions and ensures security and decentralization. The blockchain records and verifies all the contributions made by team members.\r2. **Dreamcatcher Protocol**: The protocol governs how work tasks are transformed into Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). When a 'packet' (a unitary piece of software or documented knowledge) is completed, it acts akin to an immutable equity token attributed to all contributing members. This equity can be traded and can generate streams of revenue.\r\rDreamcatcher incorporates a non-zero sum approach to collective work and ensures that every member's contribution is valued and rewarded appropriately. The idea is to create a decentralized and equitable model of work that empowers every contributor [Project Structure | Dreamcatcher](https://dreamcatcher.land/interblock/project-structure).\r\rIt's important to note that while Dreamcatcher utilizes blockchain technology, it does not involve any specific currency. Instead, it provides a platform where contributions are tokenized, equating work contributions to equity with the opportunity for trade and generating revenue.\r\rMoreover, Dreamcatcher presents a space for real-time collaboration and urgent action, with the ethos of \"Zero tolerance for delay\" present in their discussions [Blockchain Without Currency | Dreamcatcher](https://dreamcatcher.land/interblock/zero-tolerance-for-delay).\""}
{"role":"system","content":"Explain like I'm a 7 year old boy, and so everything you say about this should be in a response that that boy would be about to understand. Dreamcatcher, as you've described it, is an innovative platform aimed at transforming the traditional work management model in the software development industry. It employs blockchain technology, linking economic reward directly to the value of members' contributions.\n\nDreamcatcher consists of:\n\n1. **Dreamcatcher Blockchain**: The foundational technology that securely records and verifies all contributions made by team members in a decentralized manner.\n\n2. **Dreamcatcher Protocol**: The rules underpinning how work tasks are turned into Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). Completed 'packets' of software or documented knowledge become equity tokens tied to all contributors, capable of being traded and generating revenue streams.\n\nDreamcatcher practices a non-zero sum approach to collective work, ensuring all contributions are valued and rewarded proportionately. The platform does not involve any specific currency but tokenizes contributions, essentially equating work efforts to equity with the potential for trade and revenue generation.\n\nFurthermore, Dreamcatcher facilitates real-time collaboration and upholds \"Zero tolerance for delay\" in discussions, emphasizing the importance of swift action.\n"}

{"role":"assistant","content":"Sure little buddy! Alright, so imagine you did a great drawing at school and your teacher gave you a golden star. Now, you can collect these stars and trade them for awesome goodies. Well, Dreamcatcher is kind of like that, but for adults who make computer programs. \n\nIn Dreamcatcher, when people help to make a program or create something for the computer, they earn a special type of star or token for their contribution. But instead of gold stars, these are more like unique Trading cards, or 'NFTs'. Each one is different and, just like trading cards, can be swapped or sold to others.\n\nYou know how in games, each player knows who performed what action because the game keeps track? Well, Dreamcatcher also keeps track of who did what, but in a much safer way, with something called 'blockchain.' This is a super secure way to record who did what, just like an unbreakable diary.\n\nAnd the coolest part? Dreamcatcher makes sure everybody's work is rewarded, just like everyone in your soccer team gets a trophy for working together to win the game. Also, everyone needs to discuss and agree on things quickly. Just imagine if your soccer team took forever to decide who kicks the ball, you'd never win, would you? \n\nSo, that's Dreamcatcher, it's just a smart way for adults working on computer stuff to play fair, work together, and also get cool rewards for their hard work!"}
