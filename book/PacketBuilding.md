Packet: A packet is a method of containing all information about an idea, including it's solution and recording who did what at each point in it's development. Members on the Dreamcatcher deal in 'Packets' - unitary pieces software or documented knowledge whose quality has been verified by a trusted and neutral Quality Assurance service, and which address an identified need.

Dreamcatcher: The Dreamcatcher is defined as an Innovation Machine that highlights and promotes transparency and fairness, and gives a permissionless method for anyone, anywhere to colloborate, and use pre-existing software to reduce the effect and cost of producing software.

Attribution: Once 'done', Packets act like immutable equity that cannot be diluted or taken away; they're Attributed - i.e. owned - by all Members who contributed to their creation. They can be traded and can generate revenue streams, all with the certain knowledge that those who contributed get rewarded.

Contribution: In Dreamcatcher, Contribution is the record of who has done work on a Packet.  That contribution is stored immutably on the blockchain and is used in Attribution during a dispersal event.

Dispersal Event: When revenue is generated by a Packet, that revenue is dispersed to all members of the Dreamcatcher who are recorded in the Contribution Record of that Packet.
