{"role":"user","content":"what is the dreamcatcher ?"}
{"role":"assistant","content":"The Dreamcatcher is a platform designed to tackle several inefficiencies in the software labor market. It aims to create a more efficient, open, and incentivized market for software development and innovation. It does this by aligning economic rewards with value contributions, broadening access to global talent, implementing a transparent Quality Assurance process, allowing for granular contributions at a 'packetised' level, and facilitating better market discovery of needs and solutions. It's designed to ensure everyone involved in the software development process works towards a common goal.\n"}
{"role":"user","content":"what is a packet ?"}
{"role":"assistant","content":"In the context of Dreamcatcher, a 'packet' seems to refer to a discrete unit of work or contribution in the software development process. The platform allows for these 'packetised' contributions, which tackle the inefficiency of over-commitment or under-utilization of skills. It implies that individual tasks are broken down into smaller, manageable 'packets' which can be undertaken by different developers, allowing for more flexibility and efficient use of talent.\n"}
