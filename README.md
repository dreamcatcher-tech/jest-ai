# jest-ai

AI Agent testing suites

## Live update of a test story

Running in some trusted environment.

There is some gatekeeper that polices changes going thru, then there is some way that passed changes get fed back to clients.

The guardian needs some kind of way to refer to its core, and run the tests specified there, then pass it.

The guardian should be able to run tests on its core and update them.

## Tasks

1. Make a mock gui of what you want to see - this would be just a jest looking
   feedback screen of the tests runing
2. See how to use the test to allow some changes to be made to some filesystem
